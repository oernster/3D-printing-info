# Adhesion Guide

## 1) Clean your bed with warm dish soap and water.

## 2) spray on some IPA (isopropyl alcohol) of 70%+ concentration.

## 3) either

### a) (cheap option) spray on some hair spray onto the bed 

or 

### b) use something like printyplease.uk's cat vomit or buy some vision miner nano polymer adhesive 

or 

### c) mix up your own goo: https://goo.by.frank.af/recipe.html

## Regarding mixing your own...

So I discussed the chemical concoction for adhesive liquid for your bed on the Chemistry discord:

Me:

I'm a 3D printing guy and I am attempting to mix up some decent sticky fluid for bed adhesion for FDM printing with plastics such as PLA, ABS, ASA, PC, PETG.  Now, I have a concoction of 100ml water, 50ml of 99.9% isopropyl alcohol and 10mg of polyvinyl pyrrolidone. PVP K90.  I attempted to mix it all up but it is struggling to dissolve and makes a mess of solid inside the liquid.  

I did try heating it on my hob in a pyrex jug but my hob isn't working great so this might be the right solution.  My question really is this: assuming I can get my hob (oven top) to heat properly, will heat make it dissolve better or am I doing something incorrect here, please? 

Response:

Heating should help the PVP dissolve better in the water/IPA mixture. From what I know, PVP has a high melting point of around 250°C, so just warm/gentle heating will be sufficient, no need to boil. As well, slow, consistent heating while stirring will work better than brief bursts of high heat. This gives the PVP time to break up and dissolve gradually. 

Additionally,  use as low a heat as possible - aim for 50-60°C. Any higher risks evaporating off the alcohol too quickly.  (Be patient, it may take 30+ minutes of continuous low heat/stirring for the 10g of PVP to fully dissolve). 

Keep in mind that adding the PVP in increments (e.g. 2-3g at a time) and letting it dissolve between each addition may help too. Ensure good mixing/circulation with a magnetic stir bar if possible for even heating. The end solution should be clear with no visible undissolved particles; allow to cool fully before using.

I let it cool in a large saucepan.  Then I decanted that into a Pyrex jug, then that into individual 120ml bottles.

FYI dipping 120ml plastic bottles into the hot liquid melts the bottles so don't do that lol!!!!
LET IT COOL!

For anyone interested, I acquired 100mg of PVP90 from here: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005512514901.html
