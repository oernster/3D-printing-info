## Drying filament and keeping it dry

<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09WYBY8X8/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=oernster-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=854f084579d9449613a1732ba21fe884&camp=1634&creative=6738">Good filament dryer (SUNLU S2)</a>

UPDATE: The SUNLU S2 can be upgraded by drilling (or using a soldering iron) to create 3 small holes in the top front of the dryer and 1 small hole in the middle left of the rear of the dryer to allow for humidity to escape while drying.

FURTHER update: A _better_ dryer, though a lot pricier and possibly one of the best ones on the market currently (June 2024) is the Eibos Cyclopes which can dry 2 decently sized spools at once.  I ordered mine direct from the Eibos website.
