## Drying filament 

## You need to both dry your filament on occasion, sometimes straight out of the box (just because it's new doesn't guarantee it's not wet) and also keep it dry.

## This is particularly the case if you live in a humid environment.  Wet filament can cause bubbles in your prints making them look bad or just a complete mess on your first or subsequent layers.  One symptom of wet filament is spitting when the filament exits the nozzle at temperature.

## To dry your filament you'll want a decent dryer.

A really good dryer, which I have, though also a fair price but possibly one of the best ones on the market currently (Jan 2025) is the Eibos Cyclopes which can dry 2 decently sized 1Kg spools at once - it gets up to 70C and achieves 10% humidity in the box while having fans to release humidity.  I ordered mine direct from the Eibos website. 

Depending on how many spools you have you will also want to store them in a dry location.  A dry box comes in here.  In an ideal world you'd want a vaccuum sealed box but they cost a fortune.  So, I recommend some kind of large 80L approx plastic container with a lid that you can layer the base inside with silica desiccant beads.

NOTE: you do NOT want the blue desiccant as that is cobalt based and toxic.  Go for the orange beads.
