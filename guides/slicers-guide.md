# Slicers

Cura UI and Prusa Slicer UI are a matter of taste.
Super Slicer I used for a while but it is slowly maintained and wasn't maintained at all for a long time.  So I have moved on to Orca Slicer for my printers.

Bambu Studio is a lovely slicer but kind of customised for a Bambu.

Orca Slicer, is a fork of Bambu Studio and it's fine but I have had a couple of crashes while painting complex objects for MMU prints so, though I reported the bug(s), I have reverted to Bambu Studio for my Bambu _only_.
