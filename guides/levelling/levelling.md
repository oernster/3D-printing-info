# Levelling starter for 10

## If you want to level then (assuming Orca slicer here; adjust for your slicer of choice)...

### Right click on the build plate and create a primitive cube (NOT a voron cube).

### Choose the scale option at the top of Orca and untick uniform scale.

### Scale x and y to 300%

### Set the z height to 0.2mm

## Slice and PRINT!

# Now, while it is printing, live adjust z on your printer or through mainsail/fluidd up or down by small adjustments at a time until you have a perfect first layer.

# I know the picture is old in this directory and it's from a Prusa which I no longer own and it's for 9 well spaced squares instead but you can clearly see from that picture what a good level with a square _should_ look like.

### Continue to reprint and live adjust until you have a perfect square or set of duplicated squares across your bed.

# Now, you can print normally as you have levelled correctly.
