Manual tuning method:

**Proportional (P):** Start by increasing P until the temperature oscillates around the setpoint. Then, reduce it by half.
**Integral (I):** Increase I until the temperature stabilizes quickly without significant overshoot.
**Derivative (D):** This can be tricky. Increase D cautiously to counteract any residual oscillations without causing instability.
