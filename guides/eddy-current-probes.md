# There are 3 companies creating eddy current scanners on the market as of September 2024. 

1) Beacon revH.

2) The cartographer

3) The BTT Eddy Current Scanner which is untested by anyone I know and I would avoid that option until it has been.

### Carto:

Supports CANBUS/USB, soon™️ will support higher temperature chambers, 1/4 of the price, not as good quality components as Beacon but perfectly good.  Supports something virtually identical to Beacon Touch called Survey.  Normal and low profile variants available.

### Beacon:

Supports USB, supports higher temp chambers, pricey, high quality electronics and connector, has Beacon Touch.  Normal and low profile variants available.

### Carto CNC mount

Works with both Beacon and Carto.  Supports normal v6 hotends for SB and UHF hotends (I use standoffs but they have a custom variant for just this).  It does not support Xol if you don't have UHF though which is where the aforementioned CNC Xol Carriage comes in.
