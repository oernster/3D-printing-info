# There are 3 companies creating eddy current scanners on the market as of June 2024. 

1) Beacon revD (without ADXL or similar resonance capability), and revH (with).  Both also have the touch capability for awesome first layers which works in a similar way to Tap but at incredible speeds as well.  You will need to flash the firmware appropriately on the Beacon to support that option.   

There is a low profile variant and a normal profile variant IIRC.  Furthermore, you can choose the length of your cable I think too.

2) The cartographer (cheaper option, pretty damn good though at 1/3 the price and if you're not bothered about touch then frankly this is a great option if you don't mind the shipping time from China) has either LIS2DW accelerometer (crap) or the ADXL345 variant, without touch and with low profile/normal profile/cable length choices and also supports CANBUS or USB as choices.

A downside to the cartographer, in addition to the lack of touch capability, is also that it doesn't handle the much higher temperatures that the Beacon aka 'Bacon' is rated for; however, for most Vorons this is unlikely to be an issue IMHO; at least when passively heated.

3) The BTT Eddy Current Scanner which is untested by anyone I know and I would avoid that option until it has been.
