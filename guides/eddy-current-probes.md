# There are 3 companies creating eddy current scanners on the market as of September 2024. 

1) Beacon revH.  Beacon has a touch capability for awesome first layers which works in a similar way to Tap but at incredible speeds as well.  You will need to flash the firmware appropriately on the Beacon to support that option.   

There is a low profile variant and a normal profile variant IIRC.  Furthermore, you can choose the length of your cable too.

2) The cartographer (cheaper option, just as good, also supports CANBUS (unlike Beacon) as well as USB but has cheaper electronics and _currently_ doesn't support high temperature chambers like the revH Beacon does) is 1/3 the price with ADXL345, now with an equivalent to Beacon touch called 'survey' and with low profile/normal profile/cable length choices.

3) The BTT Eddy Current Scanner which is untested by anyone I know and I would avoid that option until it has been.

### For more information:

1) Beacon: https://beacon3d.com/ and here: https://docs.beacon3d.com/quickstart/ and also here: https://github.com/beacon3d/beacon_klipper

2) Cartographer: https://cartographer3d.com/

## Mounting

For both the Beacon and Cartographer I recommend the CNC Cartographer mount, available on the Cartographer website mentioned above.
