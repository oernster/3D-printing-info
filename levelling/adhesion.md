Adhesion Issues

If you have no adhesion, then clean it with dish soap and warm water, dry 
it, then apply some isopropyl alcohol of at least 90%+ concentration (I 
use 99.9%) and wipe that off with ideally a microfibre cloth.

If you STILL get adhesion issues, then perhaps use (best choice) some 
expensive hairspray, or, in a pinch, some cheap glue stick.

All of this assumes you've levelled correctly; this requires making sure 
your bed screws are right, then doing the paper test (you need mild to 
medium friction under the nozzle when _COLD_), then adjusting the z offset 
with a small 0.24mm height square e.g. from a 20x20mm calibration cube 
with that height only adjusted until you get a lovely first layer.  THEN 
you can print.
