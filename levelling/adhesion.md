# Adhesion Issues

If you have no adhesion, then clean it with dish soap and warm water, dry 
it, then apply some isopropyl alcohol of at least 90%+ concentration (I 
use 99.9%) and wipe that off with ideally a microfibre cloth.

If you STILL get adhesion issues, then perhaps use (best choice) some 
expensive hairspray, or, in a pinch, some cheap glue stick.

Actually, the REAL best choice for adhesion, though pricey, is Vision Miner's nano polymer adhesive.

That stuff makes prints stick like glue.  If you want to save some money it will adhere just as well with a 5:1 dilution with 99.9% IPA.

There is a cheaper but very good alternative in the UK from a company called printyplease.uk and they sell an adhesive liquid called Cat Vomit which is a EXCELLENT choice too.

All of this assumes you've levelled correctly; this requires making sure 
your bed screws are right, then doing the paper test (you need mild to 
medium friction under the nozzle when _COLD_), then adjusting the z offset 
with a small 0.24mm height square e.g. from a 20x20mm calibration cube 
with that height only adjusted until you get a lovely first layer.  THEN 
you can print.
