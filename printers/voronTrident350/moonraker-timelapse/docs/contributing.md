# Contributing to Moonraker / Moonraker-timelapse

While the moonraker-timelapse component exists independently from Moonraker,
it hooks into Moonraker as a Component. As such, contributing guidelines are the 
same as those of Moonraker:

- All source files should begin with a copyright notice in the following
  format:

        # Module name and brief description of module
        #
        # Copyright (C) 2021 YOUR NAME <YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>
        #
        # This file may be distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 license

- No line in the source code should exceed 80 characters.  Be sure there is no
  trailing whitespace.  To validate code before submission one may use `pycodestyle`
  with the following options:
      - `--ignore=E226,E301,E302,E303,W503,W504`
      - `--max-line-length=80`
      - `--max-doc-length=80`
- Generally speaking, each line in submitted documentation should also be no
  longer than 80 characters, however there are situations where this isn't
  possible, such as long hyperlinks or example return values.
- Python code should be fully annotated.  Moonraker uses the `mypy` static
  type checker for code validation with the following options:
      - `--ignore-missing-imports`
      - `--follow-imports=silent`
- Each Commit message should be in the following format:

        module name: brief description of commit

        More detailed explanation if necessary.

        Signed-off-by:  Your Name <your email address>

- By signing off on commits, you acknowledge that you agree to the
  [developer certificate of origin](../developer-certificate-of-origin)
  shown below. Your signature must contain your real name and a current
  email address.
