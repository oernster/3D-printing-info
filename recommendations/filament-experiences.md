# My personal filament experiences:

## ABS/ASA

Prusament filament - awesome ABS/ASA; my favourite filament brand.

Fillamentum ASA - lovely matte colours; prints really well.

Polymaker ABS/ASA - Amazing colours and quality.

Bamnbu ABS/ASA.

## PETG

## PLA

Fillamentum PLA

Prusament PLA

Bambu filament - lovely PLA/PLA CF/PLA Metal.

SUNLU - perfectly fine to print with; as I understand it Bambu PLA is just rebranded SUNLU.

Eryone PLA - I have had great experiences with their matte PLA.

https://www.3dqf.co.uk/ - EXCELLENT PLA and at a bargain price in the UK; I have loads of their PLA spools and can highly recommend it.
Note, however, that the PLA comes on a cardboard spool (which is NOT suitable unless you respool it for a Bambu AMS btw); that's a matter of taste but great for recycling.  Their ABS is rumoured to be average though.

Tinmorry PLA - nice matte.

## Silk PLA

ERYONE - amazing rainbow metal silk PLA that is fast changing.  Notably they have recently started selling tricolour silk PLA and it is cheaper than their competitors but just as nice.  

ZIRO - great prints from these silk PLA colours; I have ALL the silks and ALL the glitter ones; they are all amazing and print so easily.

AMOLEN - awesome silk colours; especially the bicolour ones.

ICEYUN - lovely silk colours that print well

Viking filaments (comes from Denmark - I had to arrange by email for a special postage setup to get it to the UK as they don’t deliver to the UK by default; worth it though) - honestly lovely satin PLA bicolour filaments but may need drying on receipt since not vacuum packed; just 
cellophane sealed.

Tinmorry silk PLA; prints well, though I have only tried 2 spools to date.

REDLINE - I have a bunch of silk mystic filaments and they print beautifully and look awesome.  Note, however, that they do not arrive vacuum packed and may need drying on receipt.

Hatchbox PLA - prints very well.

YOUSU - fast changing rainbow silk PLA; almost as good as ERYONE.  Their tricolour extrusion filaments are outstanding.

# Good to OK buys:

## ABS

eSUN ABS+ is OK to fairly good.

## PLA

eSUN - mediocre PLA but does the job.  

Mika3D for a multipack of 0.5Kg matte PLA reels; I bought a pack of 12 - matte reels - it’s good stuff but despite the range of colours they are rather semi-transparent which I found a little disappointing.

GEEETECH - average black PLA but well priced; prints OK but nothing to write home about.

GIANTARM - OK PLA, wouldn’t rave about it or buy again.

StrongHero - quite nice printing PLA and comes in multiple colour combos.

# Bad buys / Terrible:

## Silk PLA

SUNLU - Avoid the rainbow silk as it’s incredibly slow changing.


## PLA

PrimaSelect - sticks too well to PEI, ripping apart on finished prints - have dried using a filament dryer and also stuck in a dry box 3 times - still terrible and I ended up throwing the spool.

ICEYUN - Light blue matte adheres horribly to your PEI bed and damages it - chucked it after losing 3 beds I couldn’t scrape off with a Stanley knife.

### NOTE: 

I wouldn't really recommend Amazon basics PLA… the filament is just whatever the cheapest is when they order a batch making it quite random in quality. It is quite possible that one spool is just fine, then the next one will just just clog.  

As a general rule of thumb, avoid filament from printer manufacturers; with the key exception of prusament from prusa and bambu varieties that I've mentioned above.
