# Drying and keeping your filament dry.

### 3D printer filament drying reference kit (UK but I'm sure you can find US variations of identical or similar brands).

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01H2SZRS2/ the box(es) - 80L

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B087T2GBPX/ The beads; silica dessicant - chuck in tonnes of this in each box.  This stuff is 
rechargeable in a microwave.  Note get orange beads, not blue ones as the blue stuff is toxic; IIRC it has cobalt something (chloride?) in it.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09WYBY8X8/ IMHO a very good filament dryer on the market right now; iteration 2, based on feedback from 3d 
printerers like you and me.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01H1R0K68/ A cheap but effective hygrometer for measuring humidity (and temp as it happens); I have one in 
each box and also one reference one, in the same room, to see how effective my drying is.
