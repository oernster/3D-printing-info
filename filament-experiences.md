# My personal filament experiences:

## Premium Best buys; also pricier:

Prusament filament - awesome PLA/PETG/ASA; my favourite filament brand.

Fillamentum PLA/ASA/PETG - lovely matte colours; prints really well.

## Best buys:

ERYONE - amazing rainbow metal silk PLA that is fast changing.
ZIRO - great prints from these silk PLA colours; I have ALL the silks and 
ALL the glitter ones; they are all amazing and print so easily.
AMOLEN - awesome silk colours; especially the bicolour ones.
ICEYUN - lovely silk colours that print well; AVOID MATTE - see ‘bad buys’ 
below.
Viking filaments (comes from Denmark - I had to arrange by email for a 
special postage setup to get it to the UK as they don’t deliver to the UK 
by default; worth it though) - honestly lovely satin PLA bicolour 
filaments but may need drying on receipt since not vacuum packed; just 
cellophane sealed.
Tinmorry PLA - nice matte and silk PLA; prints well, though I have only 
tried 2 reels to date.
REDLINE - I have a bunch of silk mystic filaments and they print 
beautifully and look awesome.  Note, however, that they do not arrive 
vacuum packed and may need drying on receipt.
Hatchbox PLA - prints very well.
YOUSU - fast changing rainbow silk PLA; almost as good as ERYONE.  Also, 
their tricolour silk PLAs are absolutely BEAUTIFUL!  Their tricolour extrusion
filaments are outstanding.

## Good to OK buys:

eSUN - mediocre PLA but does the job.  The eSUN ABS+ is great.
Mika3D for a multipack of 0.5Kg matte PLA reels; I bought a pack of 12 - 
matte reels - it’s good stuff but despite the range of colours they are 
rather semi-transparent which I found a little disappointing.
GEEETECH - average black PLA but well priced; prints OK but nothing to 
write home about.
GIANTARM - OK PLA, wouldn’t rave about it or buy again.
SUNLU - ok, not exciting PLA. Avoid the rainbow as it’s incredibly slow 
changing.
StrongHero - nice printing PLA and comes in multiple colour combos.

## Bad buys / Terrible:

PrimaSelect - sticks too well to PEI, ripping apart on finished prints - 
have dried using a filament dryer and also stuck in a dry box 3 times - 
still terrible and I ended up throwing the spool.
ICEYUN: Light blue matte adheres horribly to your bed and damages it - 
chucked it after losing 3 beds I couldn’t scrape off with a Stanley knife.

### IMPORTANT NOTE: AVOID Amazon basics PLA… the filament is just whatever the 
cheapest is when they order a batch making it quite random in quality. It 
is quite possible that one spool is just fine, then the next one will just 
just clog.  Also, AVOID filament from printer manufacturers.
