### Layer shift causes that are untypical and not necessarily noted on the internet...

## 1) Grease up your rails on the y axes of your x gantry.

## 2) Tighten up your small screws on a Trident on your lead screws BUT back them off by 1/4 to 1/2 a turn since the lead screws need a little play to wobble.

## 3) Your accels may need lowering but also it might be your speeds that need lowering even at reasonable accels.

## 4) Level well.

## 5) Use Klippain Shake/Tune to get good peaks on belt shaper calibration with vertical lines for A/B belts and ideally 85%+ similarity.  90% is lovely, anything above is basically chasing unicorns but go for it if you want.
