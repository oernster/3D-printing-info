# Motor wiring.

## So you accidentally pulled out more than one motor wire from your crimped connector for your CANBUS EBB36 v1.2 board!

## Fix

Order of wires, assuming the top open revealed pins side of the JST XH (probably 2.54mm pitch) is facing upwards is as follows:

RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE.

This is how an LDO NEMA14 20T or 17T motor is supplied and is likely to be the way that it mounts to other boards aside from the BTT EBB36 v1.2 as well.
