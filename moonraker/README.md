# Moonraker API callback to Klipper with a macro example

## I have written a short python script that will ensure that you only play a sound when your print ends if it's not within the small hours of the morning.

## This might be useful if you happen to have parents or kids who are sleeping while you are printing at night and usually play a sound on completion of a print.

## This also serves as a useful guide (the python script that is) to calling a macro in klipper from a python script.
