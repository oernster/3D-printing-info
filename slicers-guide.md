# Slicers

Cura UI and Prusa Slicer UI are a matter of taste.
I have since migrated to Super Slicer which has way more options than Prusa Slicer.  Superslicer has since been very slow to be maintained so I have reverted to PrusaSlicer (as of today 2.6) for my Vorons (0.2 and Trident 350) and my Prusa MK3S+.

To migrate from Prusa Slicer to Super Slicer simply export a Config Bundle and import it into Super Slicer.

Cura (at least v5 and earlier, though it's got faster in v5) is much slower when compared with Prusa slicer or Super slicer for 

a) loading obj and STL large files

and 

b) slicing.

Bambu Studio is a lovely slicer but kind of customised for a Bambu.

Orca Slicer, which I've also tried, is a fork of Bambu and it's fine but I have had a couple of crashes while painting complex objects for MMU prints so, though I reported the bug(s), I have reverted to Bambu Studio for my Bambu.
