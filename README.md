# If you're setting up klipper, you need to clone this repository.  This is how you do it:

First off install git for your PC/linux/mac from here: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

Then on a command line or terminal (cmd.exe on windows, Terminal on a mac or linux box) go to the green Code button at the top right of the web page and click it.  Then click the two squares button to copy.

Then type:

git clone -paste in your copied command here without minus signs-

This should copy this entire repository to your local machine.

Now click on the klipper folder and read everything relevant to you.
